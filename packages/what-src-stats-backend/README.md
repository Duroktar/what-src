# what-src-stats-backend

Forked from example [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that can be deployed to
ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Next.js on Now, you can use [npm
create](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app) to initialize the
project:

```shell
$ npm create next-app my-app
```

## Deploying

Once initialized, you can deploy the Next.js example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
