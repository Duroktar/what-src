`@what-src/plugin` is like having reverse source maps for your React app. It
lets you click on elements in the browser to open them in your editor. You can
even set them to open on github if they're in a repository.

> Check out the [live demo](https://duroktar.github.io/what-src/) or the
> [video](https://github.com/Duroktar/what-src-logo/tree/master/demo). There's
> also a [website](https://duroktar.github.io/what-src/) where you can see
[all the time saved](packages/what-src-plugin-core#--enablexkcdmode-boolean) and
an interactive [example](https://duroktar.github.io/what-src/example/) built
from the [typescript-loader](packages/what-src-example-typescript-loader) package.

> NOTE: [System Hotkey](#system-hotkey) must be pressed when clicking elements.

## Install

First install the plugin from npm.

```sh
npm install @what-src/plugin --save-dev
```

> `@what-src/plugin` checks the `$EDITOR` environment variable (default:
> "vscode") to determine which editor to open your code in. Read
> [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-editor) more here.

## Usage

Choose from one of the more common setups below or check out one of the
[examples](#Are-there-any-examples).

*1. Create React App*

See the guide [here](/packages/what-src-example-cra/SETUP.md)

*2. Babel & Webpack/Express*

(For an example in typescript see [here](/packages/what-src-example-typescript-babel/))

### babel (required)

Via .babelrc or babel-loader.
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "module:@what-src/plugin"
  ]
}
```

***Now pick from one of the following to enable file opening in local editor.***

> *(Alternatively, check out the [remotes](#remotes) section for opening them on
Github).*

### Webpack-Dev-Server (Option 1: easiest)

```ts
$ webpack.config.js

const { WhatSrcServerWebpackPlugin } = require('@what-src/plugin') // <- import plugin

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.jsx',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  plugins: [new WhatSrcServerWebpackPlugin()] // <- add plugin
}
```

```json
$ package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "webpack-dev-server"
  }
}
```

```sh
npm run develop
```

> If you're already using babel and webpack-dev-server this is the recommended
> approach, as the server lifetime will be automatically managed for you. 

> NOTE: The server runs on port 8018 by default.

### Express  (Option 2: still pretty easy)

```sh
npm install @what-src/express --save-dev
```

```json
$ package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start:what-src": "what-src-express"
  },
}

$ npm run start:what-src
```

> The server will run indefinitely on port 8018 until stopped with the ctrl+c
> command.

### Express-Middleware (Option 3: Most coolest)

```sh
npm install @what-src/express-middleware --save-dev
```

```ts
$ server.js

const app = require('express')()
app.use(bodyParser.json())
...
app.post('/__what_src', require('@what-src/express-middleware'))
...
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log('what-src - Middleware service started!')
})
```

> If you're using the plugin like this than you likely already know what you're
> doing. See the babel plugin options below for configuring the request options
> sent from the client to handle clicks.

## Configuration

### System Hotkey

***The hotkey must be pressed for page clicks to trigger the plugin.***

- Windows: <kbd>WinKey</kbd> + Left Click
- MacOS: <kbd>âŒ˜ Command</kbd> + Left Click

### Remotes

Making clicks navigate to source code hosted on GitHub is possible by enabling
the [useRemote](/packages/what-src-plugin-babel/README.md#options) setting in
the [babel-plugin](/packages/what-src-plugin-babel/README.md). Have a look at
the [demo](https://duroktar.github.io/what-src/) for an example of this and
click around into the source code hosted on GitHub.

### Other options

See more configuration options in the
[@what-src/babel-plugin](/packages/what-src-plugin-babel/README.md) and
[@what-src/webpack-plugin](/packages/what-src-plugin-webpack/README.md) packages.

## What is it?

`@what-src/plugin` consists of two parts. A babel-plugin and a web-server*
(`@what-src/babel-plugin` and `@what-src/webpack-plugin` respectively).

*the web-server is also available as an `express-middleware` module, or a
complete standalone application.

Opening a local filepath from javascript in your browser is not possible so the
`@what-src/express` server is responsible for opening the requested file in the
correct editor on your system at the correct location. *To do this it uses the
[open-editor](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-editor#readme) package from [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)
which works on multiple platforms, is well maintained, and highly configurable.

The `@what-src/babel-plugin` tags any html elements it comes across in your code
with a key to a cache line containing the necessary data, which can then be sent
to the server whenever a "valid" click event is detected (ie: with the hotkey
pressed). The cache key for each element is stored in a `data-what-src` attribute
on the element itself and is guaranteed to be unique across all nodes.

The actual click events are detected using a global listener on the
`window.document` object which then sends a native xhr request to the server
with the relevant cache line for the clicked element.

#### *For Github links [open](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open) (same maintainer) is used instead.

## Why?

It seemed like a good idea and I was bored. Mix that with some free time from
the day job and this is the result. Also, it'd be cool to see the counter on
the [webapp](https://duroktar.github.io/what-src/) go wild if this thing gets users :D
